# Contributing to Oxide docs

Thanks for contributing to Oxide docs! A couple of quick guidelines for submitting PRs:

- Please keep your pull request and commit messages clear and informative.
- Make sure your contributions work in the most recent version of Chrome, Firefox, and IE.
- If you're implementing a new feature, even if it's relatively small, it's nice to open an issue before you start so that others know what you're working on and can help make sure you're on the right track.

Thanks again! Happy coding.
