# Compiling Source

While we recommend using one of the [official release builds](http://oxidemod.org/downloads/), you can compile your own builds if you'd like.

 1. Clone the git repository locally using `git clone https://github.com/OxideMod/Oxide.git`
 2. Open the solution the latest version of [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/visual-studio-2015-downloads-vs.aspx), which includes .NET Framework 4.6.
 3. Build the project using the solution. If you get errors, you're likely not using Visual Studio 2015.
