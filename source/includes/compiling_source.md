# Compiling Source

While we recommend using one of the [official release builds](http://oxidemod.org/downloads/), you can compile your own builds if you'd like. Keep in mind that only official builds are supported by the Oxide team and community.

 1. Clone the git repository locally using `git clone https://github.com/OxideMod/Oxide.git` or download the [latest ZIP](https://github.com/OxideMod/Oxide/archive/master.zip).
 2. Open the solution in the latest version of [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/visual-studio-2015-downloads-vs.aspx), which includes .NET Framework 4.6.
 3. Build the project using the solution. If you get errors, you're likely not using the latest Visual Studio 2015.
 4. Copy the files from the `Bundles` directory for your game of choice to your server installation.
