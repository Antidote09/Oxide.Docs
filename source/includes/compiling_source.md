# Compiling Source

While we recommend using one of the [official release builds](http://forum.rustoxide.com/download/), you can compile your own builds if you'd like.

 1. Clone the git repository locally using `git clone https://github.com/OxideMod/Oxide.git`
 2. Open the solution in Visual Studio (2013 is recommended, but it should work with other versions).
 3. Build the project using the solution. If you get errors, it probably means you're missing .NET framework.

<aside class="warning">Keep in mind that only official builds are supported by the Oxide team and community.</aside>
