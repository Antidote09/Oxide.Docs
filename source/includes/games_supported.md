# Games Supported

## Rust

Oxide support for Rust _(formerly Rust Experimental)_ is actively developed, though you can already do a vast amount of things with it. This is the version of Rust supported by the Facepunch developers.

## Rust Legacy

Oxide support for Rust Legacy is mostly complete, but it may receive fixes as needed. The game itself has been discontinued by the developers though. You can access this version of Rust by using the `-beta legacy` command-line parameter with SteamCMD.
