Contributing to Docs
--------------------

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Linux or OS X** — Windows may work, but is unsupported.
 - **Ruby, version 1.9.3 or newer**
 - **Bundler** — If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle` command doesn't work, just run `gem install bundler` in a terminal.

### Getting Set Up

 1. Fork this repository on GitHub.
 2. Clone *your forked repository* (not our original one) to your hard drive with `git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/slate.git`
 3. `cd slate`
 4. Install all dependencies: `bundle install`
 5. Start the test server: `bundle exec middleman server`

You can now see the docs at <http://localhost:4567>. Whoa! That was fast!

Now that the docs are all set up your machine, you'll probably want to learn more about [editing markdown](https://github.com/tripit/slate/wiki/Markdown-Syntax).

Once you've made the changes you'd feel are needed, push them to your fork and then submit a pull request. Simple as that!
